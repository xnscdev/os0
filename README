This is OS/0, a toy 32-bit operating system for the x86 architecture,
developed for learning purposes.

This repository is meant to be a central place to store all OS/0 source code
with the intention of being able to easily produce a working OS/0 installation,
including the kernel, system libraries, and userspace applications.

To build OS/0, ensure you have the following tools installed at your site:

* A GNU cross-compiler toolchain for the correct target (valid targets are
  listed as `.conf' files under the `config' directory, currently the only
  valid target is `i686-pc-elf')
* The Ninja build system to compile the project
* The Meson build system to generate build files
* GNU GRUB 2 targeting `i386-pc' (using EFI targets will not work!)

Create a build directory in the root source directory and enter it:

  mkdir -p -v build
  cd build

Configure the project using the configuration file for your target (`<file>'
should be the name of the configuration file, like `i686-pc-elf.conf'):

  meson --cross-file=../<file> ..

Build the kernel and all other programs and libraries:

  ninja

Install everything into the specified destination directory:

  DESTDIR=<DESTDIR> meson install

Be sure to set the `DESTDIR' environment variable correctly, otherwise the
OS/0 files will be installed on your root filesystem and most likely damage
your host operating system installation.

The file hierarchy under `<DESTDIR>' will be the system root of the OS/2
installation. To generate an image of this file and install GRUB, run:

  grub-mkrescue -o os0.iso <DESTDIR>

The resulting `os0.iso' file can now be used in a virtual machine to test
the operating system.
